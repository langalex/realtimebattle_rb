A couple of words about the server:
  
  The server is a sinatra app that servers an index.html which contains the polling javascript and the drawing interface.
  You can start the server from the root level of the project directory, like this:
  
    $ ruby server/realtimebattleserver.rb
    
  The state of the battlefield across requests is being held by memcache.
  The singleton resource /arena returns the state of the battlefield represented as json.
  If you'd like to draw walls, you can simply do that by returning an arrays of polyline coords.
  
  Example json doc:

    {
      walls: [
        [
          [0, 15],
          [15, 15]
        ],
        [
          [0, 30],
          [30, 30],
          [30, 30],
          [30, 0]
        ]
      ],
    
      objects: [
        {type: 'Bot', x: 10, y: 10, angle: 90, stats: {health: 100}},
        {type: 'Bot', x: 20, y: 20, angle: 0, stats: {health: 75}},
        {type: 'Bullet', x: 20, y: 20, angle: 180},
      ]
    }
